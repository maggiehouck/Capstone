      "1. State and Federal Sex Offender Registration/Notification Programs\n",
      "Sex offender registration and notification programs have been in place in the United States for more than 25 years. \n",
      "States began to develop sex offender registration programs in the late 1980s in an attempt to protect the public, \n",
      "especially children, from repeat offenders. See H.R. Rep. 109-218(I) at 28 (Sept. 9, 2005), 2005 WL 2210642 (Leg. \n",
      "Hist.). Congress enacted the first federal standards to set minimum criteria for sex offender registration in 1994. \n",
      "See Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act (\"Wetterling Act\"), \n",
      "Pub. L. No. 103-322, § 170101, 108 Stat. 1796 (1994); see also H.R. Rep. 103-392 at 6, 1993 WL 484758 (Leg. \n",
      "Hist.). The Wetterling Act used the federal spending power to encourage states to adopt sex offender registration \n",
      "laws. See U.S. v. Kebodeaux, 133 S. Ct. 2496, 2501 (2013). It also established guidelines for states to track sex \n",
      "offenders, particularly [*3]  when they moved to another jurisdiction. See Pub. L. No. 103-322, § 170101(b)(4)-(5); \n",
      "see also H.R. Rep. 103-392 at 6. By May 1996, all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, had registration \n",
      "systems for released sex offenders in place. See H.R. Rep. 105-256 at 6 (1997), 1997 WL 584298 (Leg. Hist.).\n",
      "In the early 1990s, states began enacting registry and community-notification laws to monitor the whereabouts of \n",
      "individuals convicted of sex crimes. See Nichols v. U.S., 136 S.Ct. 1113, 1116, 194 L. Ed. 2d 324 (2016); see also \n",
      "U.S. v. Crowder, 656 F.3d 870, 872 (9th Cir. 2011). In particular, during the mid-1990s, every state plus the District \n",
      "of Columbia passed a \"Megan's Law\" (named after 7-year-old Megan Kanka, who was raped and murdered by a \n",
      "neighbor). See, e.g., Cal. Pen. Code § 290.46 (requiring California Department of Justice to make available on an \n",

      "Brown, 177 Cal. App. 4th 408, 99 Cal. Rptr. 3d 209 (2009).\n",
      "In January 1996, Congress enacted the federal Megan's Law, Pub. Law 104-145, 110 Stat. 1345 (1996) (codified at \n",
      "42 U.S.C. § 14071), which, in order to protect the public, provided for dissemination of information from state sex \n",
      "offender registries, and required state and local law enforcement agencies to release necessary information to \n",
      "federal, state, and local officials responsible for law enforcement activities or for running background checks \n",
      "pursuant to the National [*4]  Child Protection Act, 42 U.S.C. § 5119, et seq.\n",
      "In 1996 Congress also enacted the Pam Lyncher Sex Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (\"Lyncher \n",
      "Act\"), Pub. L. 104-236, 110 Stat. 3093 (1996) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 14072), which required the Attorney General \n",
      "to establish a national database (the National Sex Offender Registry or \"NSOR\") so that the Federal Bureau of \n",
      "Investigation (\"FBI\") could track certain sex offenders. This national database allowed the FBI to disseminate \n",
      "information as necessary to protect the public. It also provided notification to the FBI and state agencies when \n",
      "certain sex offenders moved to other jurisdictions.\n",
      "In 1997, Congress enacted the Jacob Wetterling Improvements Act, Pub. Law No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440 (1997), \n",
      "which amended the Wetterling Act, the Lyncher Act, and other federal statutes, by adding requirements regarding \n",
      "sex offender registration and tracking. Both the Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit have upheld sex offender \n",
      "registration and notification requirements against various constitutional challenges. See, e.g., Smith v. Doe, 538 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 225913, *1Page 3 of 14\n",

      "2. SORNA\n",
      "In 2006, Congress moved towards a comprehensive set of federal standards to govern state sex offender \n",
      "registration and notification programs by enacting the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\"SORNA\"), as \n",
      "part [*5]  of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. Pub. L. No. 109-248, §§ 102-155, 120 Stat. \n",
      "587(codified in part at 42 U.S.C. §§ 16901 et seq.); see H.R. Rep. 109-218(I), at 27 (emphasizing \"gaps and \n",
      "problems with existing Federal and State laws\" due to \"lack of uniformity\" in state registration requirements and \n",
      "notification obligations); see also Nichols, 136 S.Ct. at 1119 (SORNA was intended to \"make more uniform what \n",
      "had remained 'a patchwork of federal and 50 individual state registration systems,' with 'loopholes and deficiencies' \n",
      "that had resulted in an estimated 100,000 sex offenders becoming 'missing' or 'lost'.\") (citation omitted).\n",
      "Congress enacted SORNA (which replaced the Wetterling Act in part) \"[i]n order to protect the public from sex \n",
      "offenders and offenders against children . . ..\" 42 U.S.C. § 16901. To this end, SORNA established \"a \n",
      "comprehensive national system for the registration of those offenders.\" Id. SORNA \"requires those convicted of \n",
      "certain sex crimes to provide state governments with (and to update) information, such as names and current \n",
      "addresses, for inclusion on state and federal sex offender registries.\" Reynolds v. U.S., 565 U.S. 432, 434 (2012). \n",
      "SORNA also makes it a crime for a person who is \"required to register\" under the Act and who \"travels in interstate \n",
      "or foreign commerce\" to knowingly fail to register or [*6]  update a registration. Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)).\n",
      "As spending clause legislation, SORNA conditions full Byrne Justice Assistance Grant funding on a state's \n",
      "implementation of certain requirements. See 42 U.S.C. § 16925(a) (states that fail to substantially implement the \n",
      "federally mandated requirements, as determined by the Attorney General each year, \"shall not receive 10 percent \n",
      "of the [criminal justice funding from the federal government] that would otherwise be allocated for that fiscal year . . \n",
      "..\"). SORNA requires state registries to collect specific information, such as names, addresses, physical \n",
      "descriptions, criminal history information, and photographs of offenders. Id. § 16914(a), (b). It also sets minimum \n",
      "periods of registration based on the nature and seriousness of the sex offense and the offender's history of \n",
      "recidivism, see id. §§ 16911(2)-(4), 16915, and requires states to notify certain federal agencies and other \n",
      "jurisdictions regarding the status of its registrants, id. § 16921. In addition, SORNA provides for public \n",
      "dissemination of certain information on Internet sites. Id. § 16918.\n",
      "At the federal level, SORNA directs the Attorney General, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Homeland Security \n",
      "to \"establish and maintain a system for informing [*7]  the relevant jurisdictions about persons entering the United \n",
      "States who are required to register.\" 42 U.S.C. § 16928. SORNA also re-authorized the NSOR, which includes \n",
      "information about all individuals required to register in any state registry, id. § 16919, and the National Sex Offender \n",
      "Public Website, which allows anyone to search for such information by name or within specified areas, id. § 16920; \n",
      "see http://www.nsopw.gov . SORNA also tasked the United States Marshals Service (\"USMS\") as the federal \n",
      "agency primarily responsible for enforcing sex offender registration requirements.\n",
      "3. SORNA Guidelines and USMS International Notification Efforts\n",
      "Pursuant to Congress' directive in SORNA, 42 U.S.C. § 16912(b), the Attorney General issued National Guidelines \n",
      "for Sex Offender Registration and Notification (\"SORNA Guidelines\") in July 2008. See 73 Fed. Reg. 38030 (July 2, \n",
      "2008), 2008 WL 2594934 (F.R.) 1. In issuing the SORNA Guidelines, the Attorney General noted that the \n",
      "effectiveness of registration and notification systems in states and other non-federal jurisdictions \"depends on . . . \n",
      "effective arrangements for tracking of registrants as they move among jurisdictions,\" and that without such tracking, \n",
      "a registered sex offender could \"simply disappear from the purview of the registration authorities [*8]  by moving 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 225913, *4Page 4 of 14\n",
      " from one jurisdiction to another.\" 73 Fed. Reg. at 38045. The original SORNA Guidelines were in large part aimed \n",
      "at strengthening the nationwide network of registration programs in order to avoid that result. Id.\n",
      "Moreover, while \"[a] sex offender who moves to a foreign country may pass beyond the reach of U.S. jurisdictions,\" \n",
      "including any jurisdiction's registration requirements, \"effective tracking of such sex offenders remains a matter of \n",
      "concern to the United States.\" Id. at 38066. Not only may such sex offenders return to the United States, but, as \n",
      "part of any \"cooperative efforts between the Department of Justice\" (including the USMS) and agencies of foreign \n",
      "countries, \"foreign authorities may expect U.S. authorities to inform them about sex offenders coming to their \n",
      "jurisdictions from the United States, in return for their advising the United States about sex offenders coming to the \n",
      "United States from their jurisdictions.\" Id. Accordingly, the original SORNA Guidelines directed state registries to \n",
      "require registrants to notify the registry if they intended to live, work, or attend school outside the United States; the \n",
      "registry in turn was required to notify the USMS. See id. at 38067.\n",
      "In May 2010, in a notice of [*9]  proposed supplemental SORNA Guidelines, the Attorney General indicated that \n",
      "federal agencies were continuing to develop \"a system for consistently identifying and tracking sex offenders who \n",
      "engage in international travel,\" and that in furtherance of that effort, he was adding a requirement to the SORNA \n",
      "Guidelines that registrants \"must be required to inform their residence jurisdiction of intended travel outside of the \n",
      "United States at least 21 days in advance of such travel.\" 75 Fed. Reg. 27362-02, 27364 (May 14, 2010), 2010 WL \n",

      "2. The Department Did Not Exceed Its Authority or Abuse Its Discretion\n",
      "Even if Plaintiffs could demonstrate that they have standing, the Court concludes that their second claim for relief \n",
      "fails as a matter of law. Under 22 U.S.C. Section 211a, the Department is vested with broad authority to grant and \n",
      "issue passports \"under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe.\" Under Executive Order 11295 \n",
      "(August 5, 1996), the President has delegated [*41]  authority to the Department to \"designate and prescribe for \n",
      "and on behalf of the United States rules governing the granting, issuing, and verifying of passports.\" As other courts \n",
      "have recognized, the term \"passport\" refers to a general category of official travel documents that comes in multiple \n",
      "formats, including a passport card. See, e.g., United States v. Casillas-Casillas, 845 F.3d 623, 626 (5th Cir. 2017). \n",
      "Accordingly, the Department has broad authority to grant and issue passports and to restrict access to particular \n",
      "forms of passports, including passport cards. Moreover, the text of the IML specifically prohibits the Department \n",
      "from issuing a passport—in any form—to a covered sex offender unless the passport contains the required unique \n",
      "identifier. Therefore, the Department did not exceed the scope of its authority when it promulgated the portion of the \n",
      "Final Rule that prohibits sex offenders from obtaining passport cards because the unique identifier will not fit on the \n",
      "cards.\n",
      "In addition, pursuant to its authority under 22 U.S.C. Section 211a and related executive orders, the Department \n",
      "has established a system of passport endorsements to communicate information about a passport or passport \n",
      "holder. The internal procedures for processing such endorsements are set [*42]  forth in 7 FAM 1300 Appendix B. \n",
      "As the Department points out, before the IML was passed, the Department had already determined that \n",
      "endorsements generally could not be applied to passport cards. Indeed, it is evident from 7 FAM 1300 Appendix B \n",
      "that the only endorsement that can be applied to a passport card is Endorsement 03, which is designated by the \n",
      "letter R, because the other endorsements are too long to be printed on a passport card. Therefore, Section 51.60(g) \n",
      "merely includes the same restriction applicable to all other endorsements that require text of more than a single \n",
      "letter. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Department did have authority to promulgate 22 C.F.R. Section \n",
      "51.60(g) and that it did not abuse its discretion by refusing to issue passport cards to registered sex offenders.\n",
      "IV. CONCLUSION\n",
      "For all of the foregoing reasons, the Department's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' first and second claims is \n",
      "GRANTED. In light of the Court's ruling, the Court also GRANTS the Department's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' third \n",
      "claim for declaratory relief. See Flores v. EMC Mortg. Co., 997 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1112 (E.D. Cal. 2014) (holding \n",
      "that when a plaintiff's other claims are dismissed, a claim for declaratory relief necessarily fails as a matter of law). \n",
      "Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Complaint [*43]  is DISMISSED without leave to amend,4 and this action is DISMISSED \n",
      "with prejudice.\n",
      "IT IS SO ORDERED.\n",

      "Dept. of Corrections, 66 F.3d 245, 248 (9th Cir. 1995). When amendment would be futile, dismissal may be ordered with \n",
      "prejudice. Dumas v. Kipp., 90 F.3d 386, 393 (9th Cir. 1996). In this case, because Plaintiffs cannot allege any additional facts to \n",
      "avoid dismissal of their claims against the Department, amendment would be futile, and, thus, dismissal without leave to amend \n",
