      "HN4[] In Iqbal, the Supreme Court directly [**16]  held that a court hearing an interlocutory appeal from the denial \n",
      "of a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity has \"jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his pleadings.\" Id. \n",
      "at 673. Iqbal rejected an argument similar to the one made by Bledsoe here, that \"a qualified immunity appeal \n",

      "A. Substantive Due Process Claims & Parratt\n",
      "We begin with Appellants' argument that involves only Bledsoe's substantive due process claims (Counts I, III, and \n",
      "IV).14 Initially, Bledsoe based those three claims on both procedural and substantive due process. The district court \n",
      "dismissed those counts to the extent that they alleged a procedural due process claim, because Kansas tort law \n",
      "recognizes a claim for malicious prosecution and its availability bars any § 1983 procedural due process claim \n",
      "under Parratt. That ruling is not at issue in this appeal.\n",
      "The district court [**18]  held that Counts I, III, and IV should be allowed to proceed, however, to the extent they \n",
      "alleged substantive due process violations because the court held the Parratt abstention doctrine does not apply in \n",
      "the substantive due process context. Appellants challenge that conclusion on appeal. They assert that we should \n",
      "extend Parratt to substantive due process claims and thus should \"abstain\" from deciding Bledsoe's substantive \n",
      "12 In seeking to portray this appeal as largely \"fact-related,\" Bledsoe notes that Appellants have argued against accepting all of \n",
      "the complaint's factual allegations as true and have disputed the veracity of certain facts based on conflicts with the trial \n",
      "transcripts. But because we have rebuffed Defendants' efforts to dispute the well-pleaded facts here, see supra note 3, that \n",
      "argument falls flat. We assume the well-pleaded facts to be true, and thus our review is not \"fact-related\" in the Iqbal sense of \n",
      "the term.\n",
      "13 Since Iqbal was issued, this circuit has occasionally held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal from the \n",
      "denial of a motion to dismiss in a § 1983 case. One such instance arose via this very litigation: in Bledsoe v. Vanderbilt, the \n",
      "prosecutor in Bledsoe's case filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the district court's rejection of his absolute immunity \n",
      "defense, and the court found that it did not then have jurisdiction \"to answer the question whether a plaintiff has adequately \n",
      "pleaded a cause of action.\" 934 F.3d 1112, 1120 (10th Cir. 2019). But that case is distinguishable because the availability of \n",
      "absolute prosecutorial immunity turns on whether the prosecutor's activities were either \"intimately associated with the judicial \n",
      "phase of the criminal process\" (for which absolute immunity is available), or instead were investigative or administrative activities \n",
      "(for which only qualified immunity is available). Id. at 1117 (quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S. Ct. 984, 47 L. \n",
      "Ed. 2d 128 (1976)). In contrast, one of the two elements of a qualified immunity defense is whether the plaintiff adequately pled \n",
      "a constitutional claim, so the adequacy-of-the-pleadings issue is more directly implicated here and is reviewable in this appeal. \n",
      "Montoya v. Vigil, in which this court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory appeal taken from the denial of a \n",
      "Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, is also distinguishable because the defendant there failed to raise qualified immunity at all in the \n",
      "district court. 898 F.3d 1056, 1063-65 (10th Cir. 2018). HN6[] Where, as here, Appellants appeal the denial of a properly \n",

      "review both issues. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 673.\n",
      "14 Counts I and III alleged violations of Bledsoe's due process right to a fair trial, while Count IV alleged malicious prosecution \n",
      "and unlawful pretrial detention. Below, Defendants argued as an initial matter that these claims should be construed as strictly \n",
      "procedural constitutional violations, not substantive due process violations. But the district court explicitly rejected that argument \n",
      "by finding that Counts I, III, and IV implicated substantive due process as well. Appellants have not reasserted the argument that \n",
      "these claims are strictly procedural on appeal. Thus, we assume for the purposes of the appeal that Bledsoe properly alleged a \n",
      "violation of his substantive due process rights in Counts I, III, and IV.53 F.4th 589, *601 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **16\n"

However, the application of Parratt to substantive due process claims is an open question in Tenth \\nCircuit jurisprudence.

In contrast, the Parratt doctrine asks whether the plaintiff can state a \\nconstitutional claim at all in light of alternative state-law remedies that could provide the due process of which \\nplaintiff was allegedly deprived.\\nCivil Rights Law > ... > Section 1983 Actions > Scope > Due Process in State Proceedings\\nConstitutional Law > Substantive Due Process > Scope\\nConstitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Procedural Due Process > Scope of Protection\\nHN9[]  Scope, Due Process in State Proceedings\\nOne of the three kinds of 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 claims that may be brought against the State under the Due Process \\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment arises from the Clause\\'s substantive component that bars certain arbitrary, \\nwrongful government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them. For that type of \\ndue process claim, the constitutional violation actionable under § 1983 is complete when the wrongful action is \\ntaken, meaning that a plaintiff may invoke § 1983 regardless of any subsequent state-tort remedy that might be \\navailable to compensate him for the deprivation of these rights.\\nConstitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Procedural Due Process > Scope of Protection\\n53 F.4th 589, *589 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **1Page 4 of 31\\n HN10[]  Procedural Due Process, Scope of Protection\\nThe Due Process Clause, like its forebear in the Magna Carta, was intended to secure the individual from the \\narbitrary exercise of the powers of government. Where the government takes such an action that is arbitrary in \\nsubstance rather than procedure, the constitutional violation is complete as soon as the prohibited action is taken; \\nthe independent federal remedy is then authorized by the language and legislative history of 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983. \\nStated another way, some abuses of governmental power may be so egregious or outrageous that no state post-\\ndeprivation remedy can adequately serve to preserve a person\\'s constitutional guarantees of freedom from such \\nconduct. Such abuses no doubt fall within the broad category of deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities \\nsecured by the Constitution and laws that Congress expressly intended to reach through § 1983, and to remove \\nthem from the purview of that statute would go against its text and its intent.\\nConstitutional Law > Substantive Due Process > Scope\\nGovernments > Courts > Judicial Precedent\\nConstitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Procedural Due Process > Scope of Protection\\nHN11[]  Constitutional Law, Substantive Due Process\\nAll federal courts of appeals to have considered the question have held that Parratt abstention does not extend to \\nsubstantive due process claims.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) based on \\nqualified immunity, there is a presumption that the defendant is immune from suit. To overcome this presumption, \\nthe plaintiff must show (1) the defendant\\'s actions violated a constitutional or statutory right, and (2) that right was \\nclearly established at the time of the defendant\\'s complained-of conduct.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for \\nfailure to state a claim for relief. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a complaint to contain a short and \\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 \\ndoes not require detailed factual allegations, but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-\\nharmed-me accusation. To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted \\nas true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads \\nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \\nalleged.\\nCivil Procedure > ... > Defenses, Demurrers & Objections > Motions to Dismiss > Failure to State Claim\\nCivil Procedure > ... > Pleadings > Complaints > Requirements for Complaint\\nHN16[]  Motions to Dismiss, Failure to State Claim\\nIn considering whether the complaint\\'s allegations are sufficient, the court first eliminates conclusory allegations, \\nmere labels and conclusions, and any formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action. The court then \\naccepts as true all well-pled factual allegations and considers whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to \\nrelief. In conducting this analysis, the court draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\\nCivil Procedure > ... > Pleadings > Complaints > Requirements for Complaint\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Section 1983 Actions > Scope\\nHN17[]  Complaints, Requirements for Complaint\\nIn the context of a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 action against multiple individual governmental actors, it is particularly \\nimportant that the complaint make clear exactly who is alleged to have done what to whom, to provide each \\nindividual with fair notice as to the basis of the claims against him or her.\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Immunity From Liability > Defenses\\nHN18[]  Immunity From Liability, Defenses\\n53 F.4th 589, *589 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **1Page 6 of 31\\n The second qualified-immunity inquiry focuses on whether the constitutional violation alleged was clearly \\nestablished at the time of the events at issue. To demonstrate that a right is clearly established, a plaintiff must \\nidentify an on-point United States Supreme Court or published Circuit decision, or show that the clearly established \\nweight of authority from other courts has found the law to be as the plaintiff maintains. Alleging only a violation of \\nabstract rights, without more, is insufficient because general statements of the law are inherently incapable of giving \\nfair and clear warning to a government actor. But a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law \\nmay apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question, even though the very action in question has not \\npreviously been held unlawful.\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Immunity From Liability > Defenses\\nCivil Rights Law > ... > Immunity From Liability > Local Officials > Individual Capacity\\nHN19[]  Immunity From Liability, Defenses\\nQualified immunity operates to ensure that before they are subjected to suit, officers are on notice their conduct is \\nunlawful. Existing law must have placed the constitutionality of the officer\\'s conduct beyond debate. The salient \\nquestion is whether the state of the law at the time of an incident provided fair warning to the defendants that their \\nalleged conduct was unconstitutional.\\nCivil Procedure > ... > Defenses, Demurrers & Objections > Motions to Dismiss > Failure to State Claim\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Immunity From Liability > Defenses\\nCivil Procedure > ... > Defenses, Demurrers & Objections > Affirmative Defenses > Immunity\\nHN20[]  Motions to Dismiss, Failure to State Claim\\nThe procedural posture of the qualified-immunity inquiry may be critical. Because they turn on a fact-bound inquiry, \\nqualified immunity defenses are typically resolved at the summary judgment stage rather than on a motion to \\ndismiss. Asserting a qualified immunity defense via a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion subjects the defendant to a \\nmore challenging standard of review than would apply on summary judgment. On a motion to dismiss, it is the \\ndefendant\\'s conduct as alleged in the complaint that is scrutinized for constitutionality.\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Conspiracy Against Rights > Elements\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Conspiracy Against Rights > Official Conspirators\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Conspiracy Against Rights > Private Conspirators\\nHN21[]  Conspiracy Against Rights, Elements\\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has recognized a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 conspiracy claim; \\nthat is, a conspiracy to deprive a plaintiff of a constitutional or federally protected right under color of state law. \\nProvided that there is an underlying constitutional deprivation, the conspiracy claim allows for imputed liability; a \\nplaintiff may be able to impose liability on one defendant for the actions of another performed in the course of the \\nconspiracy. Conclusory allegations of conspiracy, however, are insufficient to state a valid § 1983 claim.\\n53 F.4th 589, *589 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **1Page 7 of 31\\n Civil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Conspiracy Against Rights > Elements\\nHN22[]  Conspiracy Against Rights, Elements\\nA 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 conspiracy claim for using fabricated or false evidence was clearly established well before \\n1999.\\nCivil Procedure > ... > Pleadings > Complaints > Requirements for Complaint\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Section 1983 Actions > Elements\\nHN23[]  Complaints, Requirements for Complaint\\nA 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 plaintiff must make clear exactly who is alleged to have done what to whom, to provide each \\nindividual with fair notice as to the basis of the claims against him or her, as distinguished from collective allegations \\nagainst the state.\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Conspiracy Against Rights > Elements\\nHN24[]  Conspiracy Against Rights, Elements\\nTo state a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 conspiracy claim, a plaintiff has to allege specific facts showing an agreement and \\nconcerted action among defendants, an agreement upon a common, unconstitutional goal, and concerted action \\ntaken to advance that goal, However, because direct evidence of an agreement to join a conspiracy is rare, a \\ndefendant\\'s assent can be inferred from acts furthering the conspiracy\\'s purpose. An express agreement is \\nconsequently unnecessary. Further, while the participants in the conspiracy must share the general conspiratorial \\nobjective, they need not know all the details of the plan designed to achieve the objective or possess the same \\nmotives for desiring the intended conspiratorial result.\\nCivil Rights Law > ... > Section 1983 Actions > Elements > Protected Rights\\nHN25[]  Elements, Protected Rights\\nThe prohibition on falsification or omission of evidence, knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth, was firmly \\nestablished as of 1986.\\nCivil Rights Law > ... > Section 1983 Actions > Elements > Protected Rights\\nConstitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Procedural Due Process > Scope of Protection\\nHN26[]  Elements, Protected Rights\\nLong before 1986, it was clearly established that a defendant\\'s due process rights are implicated when the state \\nwithholds exculpatory evidence from the defense.\\nTorts > ... > Malicious Prosecution > Elements > Favorable Termination\\n53 F.4th 589, *589 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **1Page 8 of 31\\n Torts > ... > Malicious Prosecution > Elements > Malice\\nHN27[]  Elements, Favorable Termination\\nTo state a malicious prosecution claim, a plaintiff has to allege five elements: 1) the defendant caused the plaintiff\\'s \\ncontinued confinement or prosecution; 2) the original action terminated in the plaintiff\\'s favor; 3) there was no \\nprobable cause to support the plaintiff\\'s initial arrest, continued confinement, or prosecution; 4) the defendant acted \\nwith malice; and 5) the plaintiff sustained damages.\\nConstitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Search & Seizure > Scope of Protection\\nTorts > Intentional Torts > Malicious Prosecution > Civil Rights Actions\\nHN28[]  Search & Seizure, Scope of Protection\\nJudicial precedent recognizes a malicious prosecution claim under the Fourth Amendment challenging pretrial \\ndetention without probable cause.\\nCivil Rights Law > Protection of Rights > Immunity From Liability > Defenses\\nConstitutional Law > ... > Fundamental Rights > Search & Seizure > Probable Cause\\nHN29[]  Immunity From Liability, Defenses\\nProbable cause is a substantial probability that the suspect committed the crime, requiring something more than a \\nbare suspicion.

In the context of a qualified immunity defense, the court ascertains whether a defendant violated \\nclearly established law by asking whether there was arguable probable cause for the challenged conduct.

In 2015, new DNA testing and a \\nsuicide note from Bledsoe\\'s brother Tom supported Bledsoe\\'s longstanding claim that Tom was the killer and \\nBledsoe was innocent. A state court subsequently vacated Bledsoe\\'s convictions and prosecutors dismissed all \\ncharges against him.\\nIn 2016, Bledsoe filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action against ten named defendants, most of whom were Kansas law \\nenforcement officers. Bledsoe alleged that Defendants conspired to fabricate evidence implicating him in the \\nmurder and intentionally suppressed evidence that [**2]  would have proved his innocence, thereby causing him to \\nbe charged, tried, and convicted without even probable cause to believe he was guilty. At issue in this appeal is the \\ndistrict court\\'s denial of a motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  [*595]  by \\nDefendant-Appellants Randy Carreno, Troy Frost, Jeffrey Herrig, and Robert Poppa, all of whom were law \\nenforcement officers employed by the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office.1 In their Rule 12(b)(6) motion, Appellants \\nasserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity because Bledsoe 1) failed to state claims adequately alleging \\nthat Appellants deprived Bledsoe of his constitutional rights, and/or 2) any constitutional violations Bledsoe did \\nadequately allege against Appellants were not clearly established in 1999, when the events at issue occurred. The \\ndistrict court denied Appellants qualified immunity on most of Bledsoe\\'s claims. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \\n§ 1291 to consider this interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity, see Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. \\n511, 530, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985), we AFFIRM in part the district court\\'s judgment denying \\nAppellants qualified immunity, and REVERSE in part.\\nIn doing so, we first conclude that the Supreme Court\\'s decision in Parratt2 does not preclude Bledsoe\\'s \\nsubstantive [**3]  due process claims. We further conclude that Bledsoe adequately alleged substantive due \\nprocess and Fourth Amendment claims against each Appellant for evidence fabrication and for suppressing \\nexculpatory evidence (Counts I and III), a malicious prosecution claim (Count IV), conspiracy claims (Count II and \\nV), and a failure-to-intervene claim (Count VI). Lastly, we conclude that all the constitutional violations Bledsoe has \\nalleged except his failure-to-intervene claim were clearly established in 1999. The district court, therefore, correctly \\ndenied Appellants qualified immunity on all but the failure-to-intervene claim.\\nI. BACKGROUND\\nA. Factual Overview\\nFor the purposes of this appeal, we accept Bledsoe\\'s well-pled factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable \\ninferences in his favor. Ullery v. Bradley, 949 F.3d 1282, 1287 (10th Cir. 2020).3 Those facts paint a dark picture of \\nlaw enforcement\\'s plot to convict Bledsoe falsely.\\n1 Bledsoe frequently refers to all defendants as a group. Where possible, this opinion will refer to the ten named defendants \\ngenerally as \"Defendants,\" will refer to the defendant law enforcement officers as \"Defendant Officers,\" and when discussing \\nthese four officers from the Sheriff\\'s Office specifically will use \"Appellants.\"\\n2 Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 101 S. Ct. 1908, 68 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1981), overruled on other grounds by Daniels v. Williams, \\n474 U.S. 327, 328, 106 S. Ct. 662, 88 L. Ed. 2d 662 (1986).\\n3 Appellants argue that some of the allegations in Bledsoe\\'s complaint are \"contrary to the prior criminal and post-conviction \\nproceedings\" and thus should not be accepted as true, even at this stage of litigation. Aplt. Br. at 6 (citing Kan. Penn Gaming \\nLLC v. Collins, 656 F.3d 1210, 1214 (10th Cir. 2011)). In support of that argument, Appellants attached to their Rule 12(b)(6) \\nmotion a transcript of Bledsoe\\'s state criminal trial, which the district court agreed to consider for its contents where Defendants \\nprovided specific citations to the transcript. HN1[] This court can rely on the trial transcript \"to show [its] contents, not to prove \\nthe truth of the matters asserted therein.\" Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 1244, 1264 n.24 (10th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks \\nomitted). Accordingly, the facts recited here are taken from Bledsoe\\'s Second Amended Complaint and to some extent from the 53 F.4th 589, *594 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **1Page 11 of 31\\n In November 1999, Bledsoe was twenty-three years old and working as a farmhand. He lived in Jefferson County \\nwith  [*596]  his wife Heidi and their two young sons. Heidi\\'s fourteen-year-old sister Camille was living with the \\nfamily at that time as well. Bledsoe\\'s older brother Tom, then twenty-five years old, [**4]  lived nearby with his \\nparents. Tom was \"partially deaf,\" \"had a limited social life, certain intellectual limitations, and a history of troubling \\nsexual behavior that included pursuing young girls.\" (2d Am. Compl. (Aplt. App. 26-53) at ¶ 28.)\\nOn November 5, 1999, Camille arrived home from school at 4:20 p.m., but was not there when her friend stopped \\nby at 5:00 p.m. Bledsoe and Heidi reported the girl\\'s disappearance to the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office and \\nsearched for Camille for the next forty-eight hours. On November 7, Tom separately told his Sunday school teacher \\nand his parents that he had killed Camille. Tom\\'s parents immediately hired attorney Michael Hayes to represent \\nTom.4 Hayes and Tom met with Sheriff\\'s Office personnel that same evening, November 7. They told officers that \\nCamille had been shot several times, including once in the back of the head, and that her body was hidden in the \\ntrash dump on the property where Tom lived. Tom and Hayes then took officers to that trash dump, where they \\nfound Camille\\'s body, along with three bullet casings, an X-rated movie, and a T-shirt that read \"Countryside Baptist \\nChurch,\" of which Tom was a member. (Id. at ¶¶ 28, 38.) Camille\\'s [**5]  wounds matched Tom\\'s description. \\nHayes turned over the murder weapon—Tom\\'s recently purchased nine-millimeter pistol. The coroner found sperm \\nin the victim\\'s vagina, but could not say who it belonged to or whether Camille had been forcibly sexually abused. \\nTom was arrested and charged with Camille\\'s murder.\\nDespite this substantial evidence against Tom, Defendants allegedly conspired to frame Bledsoe instead for the \\nmurder.5 Defendants did so despite the fact that Bledsoe\\'s whereabouts were accounted for from the time Camille \\nwent missing on November 5 to the time of Tom\\'s confession on November 7. Bledsoe\\'s alibi was corroborated by \\nnumerous witnesses, a time-stamped receipt, phone records, and even testimony of Appellant Carreno—the lead \\ninvestigator on the case—who had searched for Camille alongside Bledsoe on November 6.\\nBledsoe alleges that Defendants\\' general plan to frame him was to have Tom recant his confession and to coach \\nTom to explain that he knew the details of the murder because Bledsoe had told him those details. Specifically, \\nTom would state falsely that he met Bledsoe at a roadway intersection on Saturday, November 6, at which time \\nBledsoe confessed to Tom that he had [**6]  killed Camille, told Tom the details of the murder, and \"persuaded \\nTom to take the blame by threatening to expose Tom\\'s history of viewing X-rated movies, masturbating, and \\nattempting to have sex with a dog.\" (Id. at ¶ 52.) Bledsoe claims that this meeting never happened.\\n\"Shortly before Tom\\'s staged recantation,\" Tom\\'s defense attorney \"Hayes sought [Bledsoe] out and told him that \\nHayes was taking Tom off the \\'hot seat\\' and putting [Bledsoe] on, or words to that effect.\" (Id. at ¶ 55.) On \\nNovember 12, a Kansas Bureau of Investigation (\"KBI\") officer, Defendant Johnson, administered  [*597]  lie \\ndetector tests to both Tom and Bledsoe.6 During his exam, Tom recanted his confession and incriminated Bledsoe. \\nBut Tom \"failed the question\" of whether he shot Camille, and was so overcome with guilt immediately after the lie \\ndetector test that he confessed again to killing Camille. (Id. at ¶ ¶ 58-59.) Nonetheless, the KBI officer told Tom that \\nhe should continue lying to implicate Bledsoe.\\ndistrict court\\'s opinion below. We assume them to be true for the purposes of this appeal. We reject Appellants\\' general \\nassertions on appeal as to what the trial transcript says in an attempt to contradict Bledsoe\\'s factual allegations.\\n4 Hayes is a named defendant in this suit, but he is not involved in this appeal.\\n5 At this point, the motive for the scheme is unclear, but one theory alleged by Bledsoe is that the prosecutor Jim Vanderbilt—\\nanother named defendant who is not involved in this appeal—was indebted to Hayes for helping Vanderbilt \"avoid . . . legal \\nexposure for Vanderbilt\\'s appropriation of county funds for personal use.\" (2d Am. Compl. at ¶ 51.)\\n6 Johnson and several other KBI officers are named defendants in this suit, but are not involved in this appeal. Bledsoe alleged \\nthat these KBI \"[o]fficers were integral and active participants in the investigation of [Camille\\'s] death and directed various \\naspects of the investigation,\" including gathering physical evidence, executing search warrants, photographing the crime scene \\nand victim, conducting and reviewing the polygraph examinations, interviewing witnesses, and making \"dozens of police \\nreports.\" (2d Am. Compl. ¶ 18.)53 F.4th 589, *595 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **3Page 12 of 31\\n Bledsoe passed his lie detector test by \"truthfully disavowing any involvement in the crime.\" (Id. at ¶ 60.) Defendant \\nJohnson falsified the results, however, inaccurately reporting that Tom had been truthful in denying [**7]  his \\ninvolvement in the murder, while Bledsoe had been deceptive in denying that he was involved. Based on those \\nfalse polygraph results, the prosecutor dropped the charges against Tom, \"pursuant to an agreement that was \\nnever disclosed to\" Bledsoe or his defense counsel, and arrested and charged Bledsoe. (Id. at ¶¶ 61-62, 88.)\\nTom\\'s fabricated story was \"the central piece\" of the prosecution\\'s evidence against Bledsoe at trial. (Id. at ¶ 67.) \\nCarreno and others at the Sheriff\\'s Office \"knowingly and purposefully falsified\" Tom\\'s story to fit his fictitious \\nroadside meeting with Bledsoe \"into the brief period of time in which they believed (wrongfully) that [Bledsoe] lacked \\nan alibi.\" (Id. at ¶ 64.)\\nDefendants also \"withheld evidence of Tom\\'s guilt from [Bledsoe\\'s] defense and the prosecution and generated \\nadditional false evidence against [Bledsoe] to secure his prosecution and conviction.\" (Id. at ¶ 68.) For example, in \\naddition to fabricating Tom\\'s story implicating Bledsoe in the murder and falsifying the polygraph results, \\nDefendants fabricated an incriminating statement from Bledsoe indicating that he had returned home at the same \\ntime that Camille disappeared from their house. [**8]  In fact, Bledsoe had denied returning home that afternoon.\\nDefendants also failed to disclose to Bledsoe and his defense attorney \"Tom\\'s many inculpatory statements\" \\nconfessing to the murder and his giving specific details of the crime, as well as \"evidence that Tom had a history of \\npursuing young girls roughly Camille\\'s age and had made sexual advances on Camille just a few weeks before her \\ndisappearance.\" (Id. at ¶ 69, 74.)\\nIn addition, police skewed the investigation towards Bledsoe and away from Tom. For example, while officers \\nthoroughly searched Bledsoe\\'s home and vehicle and also gathered clothing from a third suspect, they \\n\"purposefully declined to subject Tom\\'s home—or even his room or clothing—to any rigorous forensic examination,\" \\nand \"declined to collect any physical evidence from the vehicles Tom drove,\" including the truck in which Tom said \\nhe shot Camille. (Id. at ¶¶ 81-82.) Additionally, the officers \"intentionally declined to collect any physical evidence \\nfrom\" the shovel Tom said he had used to bury Camille. (Id. at ¶ 82.) They also allowed Tom\\'s father to handle the \\nmurder weapon—Tom\\'s gun—before turning it over to police.\\nThe prosecutor offered Bledsoe a plea deal [**9]  under which he would be sentenced to  [*598]  five years\\' \\nimprisonment if he pled guilty. Bledsoe turned down the deal and went to trial, where a jury convicted him of \\nmurder, kidnapping, and taking indecent liberties with a child. The trial judge sentenced Bledsoe to life in prison \\nplus sixteen years. Bledsoe appealed and sought habeas relief, to no avail.\\nIn 2015, after Bledsoe had been in prison for sixteen years, newly available DNA testing established that the semen \\nfound in Camille\\'s body likely matched Tom\\'s DNA; it was conclusively not a match for Bledsoe. Tom committed \\nsuicide soon after this revelation and left a note stating that he had killed Camille and:\\nI sent an innocent man to prison. The Jefferson County police and county attorney Jim Vanderbelt [sic] made \\nme do it. I was told by Vanderbelt [sic] to keep my mouth shut. . . .\\n. . . .\\nI tried telling the truth but no one would listen. I was told to keep my mouth shut. . . .\\nFloyd S Bledsoe is an innocent man.\\n(Id. at ¶ 101.) Tom also left a diagram that showed where he shot Camille, which led the police to a fourth bullet \\ncasing that had not previously been found.\\nThe state trial court vacated Bledsoe\\'s convictions and the county prosecutor [**10]  dismissed the charges against \\nhim. Bledsoe filed the instant action shortly after his release from prison.\\nB. Factual Allegations as to Each Appellant53 F.4th 589, *597 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **6Page 13 of 31\\n \\n1. Randy Carreno\\nCarreno was a law enforcement officer for the Sheriff\\'s Office and was the lead investigator on Camille\\'s case. \\nBledsoe alleged that Carreno knew Bledsoe had not met Tom at the intersection on Saturday, November 6—where \\nTom falsely said Bledsoe had confessed to killing Camille—because Carreno was with Bledsoe most of that day \\nlooking for Camille. Accordingly, Bledsoe asserts that \"Carreno and other Defendant Officers knowingly and \\npurposefully falsified Tom\\'s statements to fit the fictitious roadside meeting into the brief period of time in which they \\nbelieved (wrongly) that [Bledsoe] lacked an alibi, even though they knew that the entire roadside meeting never \\nhappened.\" (Id. at ¶ 64.)7 Bledsoe further alleged that \"Carreno . . . knowingly coached Tom to provide false \\nexplanations for how he had known so many details about Camille\\'s murder,\" and Carreno \"purposefully withheld \\ndocumentation of Tom\\'s activities and statements between November 8th and 12th,\" the dates Tom was arrested \\nand then released. (Id. at ¶¶ 65, 72.) [**11] \\nAdditionally, the district court reasonably inferred from the complaint\\'s factual allegations that Carreno was at the \\nmeeting between Tom\\'s defense counsel Hayes and prosecutor Vanderbilt when the conspiracy against Bledsoe \\nwas hatched, or that Carreno met with Hayes soon thereafter. The district court based that inference  [*599]  on \\nBledsoe\\'s allegations that Hayes met with prosecutor Vanderbilt and/or others, that Hayes conspired with Carreno \\nto pin the murder on Bledsoe, and that Hayes and Carreno found a willing ally for their scheme in Vanderbilt.\\n2. Robert Poppa\\nPoppa was a law enforcement officer also employed by the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office. Bledsoe alleged that \\nPoppa was present when, on the night Tom turned himself in, Tom confessed in great detail to murdering Camille. \\nBledsoe specifically claimed that Poppa, along with other officers,\\n- \"purposefully withheld their documentation of [Tom\\'s] inculpatory statements\";\\n- \"purposefully withheld their documentation of Tom\\'s desire to commit suicide\";\\n- \"subjected [Bledsoe\\'s] home and vehicle to thorough, rigorous forensic examination,\" but\\n- \"purposefully declined\" to search Tom\\'s home, room, clothing, truck (where Tom said he shot [**12]  Camille), \\nand the shovel Tom said he used to bury the victim; and\\n- allowed Tom\\'s father to handle the murder weapon and ammunition, in order to further their scheme of \\nwrongfully framing Bledsoe for the murder.\\n(Id. at ¶¶ 71, 79, 81-83.)\\n3. Troy Frost\\nFrost, too, was a law enforcement officer with the Sheriff\\'s Office. Bledsoe alleged that Frost\\n- \"withheld evidence that Tom had a history of pursuing young girls roughly Camille\\'s age and had made sexual \\nadvances on Camille just a few weeks before her disappearance\";\\n- \"falsely claimed that [Bledsoe] had confessed on two separate occasions to having visited his home at the \\ntime Camille disappeared from it\";\\n- \"signed a search warrant affidavit to that effect,\" knowing Bledsoe \"had never made such a statement\";\\n7 Appellants complain that Bledsoe failed to \"allege what statements were altered, in what way the statements were changed, \\nhow the statements were documented, to whom the statements were made, or what motivation Carreno or anyone else would \\nhave had to falsify Tom\\'s statement.\" (Aplt. Br. 17.) HN2[] The district court correctly rejected these arguments because \" Fed. \\nR. Civ. P. 8(a)(1) requires only \\'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\\' It \\'does not \\nrequire \"detailed factual allegations.\"\\'\" (Aplt.

Ed. 2d 929) (2009)).)53 F.4th 589, *598 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **10Page 14 of 31\\n - along with Poppa and Herrig, \"subjected [Bledsoe\\'s] home and vehicle to thorough, rigorous forensic \\nexamination\"; but\\n- \"intentionally\" and \"purposefully declined\" to search Tom\\'s home, room, clothing, truck (where Tom said he \\nshot the victim) and shovel Tom said he used to bury the victim; and\\n- allowed Tom\\'s father to handle the murder weapon and ammunition, in order to further their scheme of \\nwrongfully framing Bledsoe for the murder. [**13] \\n(Id. at ¶¶ 74, 79, 81-83, 89, 92).8\\n4. Jeffrey Herrig\\n [*600]  Undersheriff Jeffrey Herrig was in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s \\nOffice, and his duties included the supervision of Carreno, Poppa, and Frost. Bledsoe alleged that Herrig, along \\nwith Poppa and Frost,\\n- \"subjected [Bledsoe\\'s] home and vehicle to thorough, rigorous forensic examination\"; but\\n- \"intentionally\" and \"purposefully declined\" to search Tom\\'s home, room, clothing, truck (where Tom said he \\nshot the victim) and the shovel Tom said he used to bury the victim; and\\n- allowed Tom\\'s father to handle the murder weapon and ammunition, in order to further their scheme of \\nwrongfully framing Bledsoe for the murder.\\n(Id. at ¶¶ 79, 81-83.)\\nC. Procedural background\\nBledsoe initiated this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 litigation against ten defendants, including the four members of the \\nJefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office who are the Appellants here,9 several members of the Kansas Bureau of \\nInvestigation, the County prosecutor Vanderbilt, and Tom\\'s defense attorney Hayes. Six of Bledsoe\\'s § 1983 claims \\nare relevant in this appeal:\\nCount I, alleging all Defendants deprived Bledsoe of due process—a fair trial—in violation of the Fourteenth \\nAmendment by fabricating Tom\\'s [**14]  \"testimonial evidence\" used against Bledsoe.\\nCount II, alleging all Defendants conspired to deprive Bledsoe of due process by fabricating Tom\\'s testimonial \\nevidence against Bledsoe.\\n8 Relying on the transcript of Bledsoe\\'s criminal trial, Appellants on appeal challenge the veracity of some of the allegations \\nBledsoe makes against Frost. Appellants first assert on appeal that we should not accept as true Bledsoe\\'s allegation that Frost \\n\"falsely claim[ed] that Bledsoe confessed to having visited his home when Camille disappeared,\" because the trial transcript \\ncontradicts that allegation in that Frost admitted on cross-examination that he had merely misunderstood Bledsoe as confessing \\nto the visit. (Aplt. Br. 43-44.) The admission induced on cross-examination does not negate Bledsoe\\'s allegation that Frost used \\nthe false statement to get a warrant to search Bledsoe\\'s house. Moreover, the district court correctly held that Frost\\'s false \\ntestimony on direct examination was \"material\" to Bledsoe\\'s convictions because both the state appellate and federal habeas \\ncourts expressly relied on Frost\\'s direct-examination testimony that Bledsoe admitted to going home at the time Camille \\ndisappeared to uphold his convictions. (Aplt. App. 897-98.) Second, Appellants assert that Bledsoe\\'s defense counsel had \\ninformation that Tom had flirted with a fourteen-year-old, so Frost did not suppress information that Tom had a history of \\npursuing young girls roughly Camille\\'s age. But this does not negate Frost\\'s alleged failure to disclose the highly relevant \\ninformation that Tom had made sexual advances toward Camille specifically a few weeks before she was killed.\\n9 In addition to suing these four employees of the Sheriff\\'s Department, Bledsoe also sued Roy Dunnaway, who was the Sheriff \\nof Jefferson County at the time of the murder. After Dunnaway died, Bledsoe removed him as a named defendant.53 F.4th 589, *599 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **12Page 15 of 31\\n Count III, alleging Defendant Officers (Appellants and the KBI Defendants) deprived Bledsoe of due process—\\na fair trial—by fabricating additional inculpatory evidence used against Bledsoe and suppressing exculpatory \\nevidence that would have established Bledsoe\\'s innocence.\\nCount IV, alleging Tom\\'s defense attorney Hayes and the Defendant Officers maliciously caused Bledsoe\\'s \\narrest, pretrial detention, and prosecution without probable cause, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth \\nAmendments\\' due process guarantees.\\nCount V, alleging Tom\\'s defense attorney Hayes and the Defendant Officers conspired to deprive Bledsoe of \\nhis constitutional rights by maliciously prosecuting him, suppressing exculpatory evidence and fabricating \\nevidence against Bledsoe.10\\nCount VI, alleging the Defendant Officers failed to intervene to prevent the deprivation of Bledsoe\\'s \\nconstitutional rights.11\\nAppellants filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, arguing that Bledsoe failed to  [*601]  state claims against them \\non which relief can be granted and that they were each entitled to [**15]  qualified immunity. The district court \\ngranted that motion in part, dismissing Counts I, III, and IV to the extent they alleged procedural due process claims \\nand otherwise denied the motion. Appellants immediately took this interlocutory appeal challenging the partial \\ndenial of their motion to dismiss.\\nII. JURISDICTION\\nHN3[] This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to consider Appellants\\' interlocutory appeal from the \\n\"district court\\'s denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.\" Mitchell, 472 \\nU.S. at 530. A qualified immunity defense asserted in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss generally presents two \\nquestions: 1) whether the plaintiff has alleged facts showing a constitutional violation; and 2) whether that \\nconstitutional violation was clearly established or obvious at the time of the incident in question. See VDARE \\nFound. v. City of Colo. Springs, 11 F.4th 1151, 1159, 1175 (10th Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 1208, 212 L. \\nEd. 2d 216 (2022).\\nBledsoe argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\\'s determination addressing the first \\ninquiry, whether he failed to state a plausible constitutional claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6). We disagree, and \\nconclude that we have proper jurisdiction over the 12(b)(6) questions raised here under the Supreme Court\\'s \\nholding in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 671-75, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009).\\nHN4[] In Iqbal, the Supreme Court directly [**16]  held that a court hearing an interlocutory appeal from the denial \\nof a motion to dismiss based on qualified immunity has \"jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his pleadings.\" Id. \\nat 673. Iqbal rejected an argument similar to the one made by Bledsoe here, that \"a qualified immunity appeal \\nbased solely on the complaint\\'s failure to state a claim, and not on the ultimate issues relevant to the qualified \\nimmunity defense itself, is not a proper subject of interlocutory jurisdiction.\" Id. at 672 (internal quotation marks \\nomitted). In so holding, the Supreme Court distinguished Johnson v. Jones, upon which Bledsoe relies and which \\nheld that an appellate court could not hear an interlocutory appeal from an order denying qualified immunity at the \\nsummary-judgment stage of litigation because the legal inquiry at that stage was predominantly \"fact-based.\" 515 \\nU.S. 304, 317, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 132 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1995). HN5[] Appeals from motions to dismiss, in contrast, \\nare further from the \"law-fact divide\" and consequently better suited to immediate review. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 674; \\n10 Bledsoe identified Counts II and V as conspiracy counts specifically, but he also alleged a conspiracy in each of Counts I \\nthrough V.\\n11 Bledsoe also pled a municipal liability claim against the County\\'s Board of Commissioners and now-Sheriff Herrig sued in his \\nofficial capacity (Count VII) and a state-law indemnification claim (Count VIII). Those claims are not at issue in this appeal.\\n53 F.4th 589, *600 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **14Page 16 of 31\\n \\nsee also Lowe v. Raemisch, 864 F.3d 1205, 1207 (10th Cir. 2017) (stating, in an appeal from the denial of qualified \\nimmunity, that \"reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint . . . involves a pure issue of law\").12\\nBledsoe\\'s reliance on Johnson instead of Iqbal is [**17]  therefore unavailing, because this case reaches us on an \\nappeal from a ruling on a motion to dismiss rather  [*602]  than an appeal from summary judgment. We are bound \\nto follow Iqbal, and accordingly hold that we have proper jurisdiction over issues related to the sufficiency of the \\npleadings as well as the application of the qualified immunity defense.13 We thus have jurisdiction to review both \\nwhether Bledsoe has adequately alleged constitutional violations and whether the alleged constitutional violations \\nwere clearly established at the time of the events at issue here in 1999.\\nIII. DISCUSSION\\nA. Substantive Due Process Claims & Parratt\\nWe begin with Appellants\\' argument that involves only Bledsoe\\'s substantive due process claims (Counts I, III, and \\nIV).14 Initially, Bledsoe based those three claims on both procedural and substantive due process. The district court \\ndismissed those counts to the extent that they alleged a procedural due process claim, because Kansas tort law \\nrecognizes a claim for malicious prosecution and its availability bars any § 1983 procedural due process claim \\nunder Parratt. That ruling is not at issue in this appeal.\\nThe district court [**18]  held that Counts I, III, and IV should be allowed to proceed, however, to the extent they \\nalleged substantive due process violations because the court held the Parratt abstention doctrine does not apply in \\nthe substantive due process context. Appellants challenge that conclusion on appeal. They assert that we should \\nextend Parratt to substantive due process claims and thus should \"abstain\" from deciding Bledsoe\\'s substantive \\n12 In seeking to portray this appeal as largely \"fact-related,\" Bledsoe notes that Appellants have argued against accepting all of \\nthe complaint\\'s factual allegations as true and have disputed the veracity of certain facts based on conflicts with the trial \\ntranscripts. But because we have rebuffed Defendants\\' efforts to dispute the well-pleaded facts here, see supra note 3, that \\nargument falls flat. We assume the well-pleaded facts to be true, and thus our review is not \"fact-related\" in the Iqbal sense of \\nthe term.\\n13 Since Iqbal was issued, this circuit has occasionally held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear an interlocutory appeal from the \\ndenial of a motion to dismiss in a § 1983 case. One such instance arose via this very litigation: in Bledsoe v. Vanderbilt, the \\nprosecutor in Bledsoe\\'s case filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the district court\\'s rejection of his absolute immunity \\ndefense, and the court found that it did not then have jurisdiction \"to answer the question whether a plaintiff has adequately \\npleaded a cause of action.\" 934 F.3d 1112, 1120 (10th Cir. 2019). But that case is distinguishable because the availability of \\nabsolute prosecutorial immunity turns on whether the prosecutor\\'s activities were either \"intimately associated with the judicial \\nphase of the criminal process\" (for which absolute immunity is available), or instead were investigative or administrative activities \\n(for which only qualified immunity is available). Id. at 1117 (quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S. Ct. 984, 47 L. \\nEd. 2d 128 (1976)). In contrast, one of the two elements of a qualified immunity defense is whether the plaintiff adequately pled \\na constitutional claim, so the adequacy-of-the-pleadings issue is more directly implicated here and is reviewable in this appeal. \\nMontoya v. Vigil, in which this court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory appeal taken from the denial of a \\nRule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, is also distinguishable because the defendant there failed to raise qualified immunity at all in the \\ndistrict court. 898 F.3d 1056, 1063-65 (10th Cir. 2018). HN6[] Where, as here, Appellants appeal the denial of a properly \\nraised qualified immunity defense alongside their challenge to the sufficiency of the pleadings, this court has jurisdiction to \\nreview both issues. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 673.\\n14 Counts I and III alleged violations of Bledsoe\\'s due process right to a fair trial, while Count IV alleged malicious prosecution \\nand unlawful pretrial detention. Below, Defendants argued as an initial matter that these claims should be construed as strictly \\nprocedural constitutional violations, not substantive due process violations. But the district court explicitly rejected that argument \\nby finding that Counts I, III, and IV implicated substantive due process as well. Appellants have not reasserted the argument that \\nthese claims are strictly procedural on appeal. Thus, we assume for the purposes of the appeal that Bledsoe properly alleged a \\nviolation of his substantive due process rights in Counts I, III, and IV.53 F.4th 589, *601 ; 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 31579, **16'"
