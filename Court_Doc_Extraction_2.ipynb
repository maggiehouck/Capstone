      "In March of 2011, Plaintiff Dennis Zamora filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission a Charge of \n",
      "Discrimination against his employer based on National Origin. [Doc. 3] He was issued his right to sue [Doc. 3], and \n",
      "timely filed this suit on May 21, 2012, against Las Cruces Public Schools and Stan Rounds (Individually), alleging \n",
      "National Origin Discrimination; a Hostile Work Environment; Wrongful Termination; and Negligent Hiring, Training \n",
      "and Supervision and seeking both compensatory and punitive damages. [Doc. 1] On April 1, 2013, the [*2]  Court \n",
      "Page 2 of 13\n",
      " entered a Stipulated Order Granting Defendants' Motion for Partial Dismissal with Prejudice, dismissing Plaintiff's \n",
      "claim of Negligent Training and Supervision as well as his claim for punitive damages. [Doc. 66] In the same Order, \n",
      "the Court dismissed Plaintiff's claims against Defendant Stan Rounds individually and substituted the Board of \n",
      "Education for the Las Cruces Public Schools (instead of Las Cruces Public Schools) as the sole remaining \n",
      "Defendant in this action. [Doc. 66]\n",
      "Plaintiff began working for Defendant Board of Education for the Las Cruces Public Schools in 1994, and became \n",
      "an administrator for Defendant in 2005. [Doc. 51, p. 12, A.1-A.2] His last position was Title I Coordinator, and, in \n",
      "that position, he coordinated approximately seven federal, state and private programs. [Doc. 51, p. 12, A.3] His last \n",
      "supervisor gave him positive evaluations based on his work performance. [Doc. 51-1 p. 22:1-6] Plaintiff has \n",
      "submitted testimony by his supervisor, his second level supervisor and one of his peers that they never observed \n",
      "him create a hostile work environment or make inappropriate or sexual advances. [Doc. 51-1, p. 21:8-25; Doc. 51-4 \n",
      "p. 9:22 to 10:22; Doc. 51-2, p. [*3]  18:7-14] Defendant concedes that Plaintiff had a satisfactory career and that it \n",
      "did not terminate him for poor work performance. [Doc. 61, p. 3, ¶ A.3]\n",
      "Stan Rounds became the Superintendent for Defendant in approximately 2007. [Doc. 51-2, p. 10:11-15] \n",
      "Superintendent Rounds hired James Nesbitt, a former superintendent from Truth or Consequences, to be the \n",
      "Director of Human Resources for Defendant, even though Superintendent Rounds believed that in Mr. Nesbitt's \n",
      "previous position a lawsuit or EEOC charge was filed against him for allowing a \"class simulation\" about \n",
      "segregation in which signs were hung above drinking fountains stating \"Whites Only\" and \"People of Color.\" [Doc. \n",
      "51-7, p. 1; Doc. 51-2, p. 64:2 to 65:9] Superintendent Rounds testified that he hired Mr. Nesbitt because \"we did \n",
      "due diligence on his background. He maintained his license, et cetera, et cetera. I've known Mr. Nesbitt as a \n",
      "superintendent for a number of years, and I had already drawn conclusions about his abilities.\" [Id.]\n",
      "When Mr. Nesbitt retired, Superintendent Rounds \"laterally transferr[ed]\" a Caucasian woman, Andrea Fletcher, to \n",
      "the position of Director of Human Resources without advertising the position. [Doc. [*4]  61-3, p. 60:2-9] He \n",
      "subsequently \"re-codified [her] operation, redefined those duties slightly and took the directorship and translated it \n",
      "to an assistant superintendency.\" [Doc. 61-3, p. 60:22 to 61:3] Plaintiff's immediate supervisor, Erlinda Martinez, a \n",
      "Hispanic, testified that both she and another Hispanic woman (who had been the administrator in charge prior to \n",
      "Superintendent Rounds being hired) had more experience than Ms. Fletcher, and Ms. Martinez would have liked \n",
      "the opportunity to apply for the position. [Doc. 51-1, p. 36:13 to 39:18] Ms. Martinez testified: \"[T]here's a flaw in the \n",
      "system in terms of inconsistency for advancement[.] . . . So the appointments it seemed like a pattern, yes, that \n",
      "there was a lot of white people appointed, but there was also a couple of Hispanics in there as well. So my feelings, \n",

      "Then, in September of 2010, two different employees who worked under him filed complaints of Harassment, \n",
      "Intimidation or Bullying. [Doc. 45-1, p. 15] One employee complained that Plaintiff screamed and yelled insults such \n",
      "as \"you're worthless\" and \"now I'm not impressed,\" called her a complainer and one who gripes, and called her \n",
      "lazy. She complained that he threw some forms at her that were not signed, and told her he had eyes and ears \n",

      "45-1, p. 19, ¶ 4; Doc. 45-1 p. 33] The other employee complained that Plaintiff yelled at her while he stood bending \n",
      "over her with his hands on his knees, his face about 12 inches from her. [Doc. 45-1, p. 19, ¶ 5] She said that this \n",
      "incident made her cry for ten minutes and she felt \"thoroughly devastated.\" [Id.] She complained [*6]  that he yelled \n",
      "at her when she could not access or respond to emails because her computer had not yet been set up, and that he \n",
      "yelled at her over the radio which was overheard by the people at the location. [Id.] She also stated that she was \n",
